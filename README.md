# Rust_program_for_Currency_to_text
Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages. The project can rightly determine the textual output till 1 crore and a decimal precision up-to 2. Program will ask the user to enter a number and the expected output will be the text of corresponding currency. If a number is an integer then it will not return anything after decimal places whereas if the output is a double then it will return the paise corresponding to it divided by 100.
